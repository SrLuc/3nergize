# 3nergizer
This project was developed by me and my college team for the Mobile Coding discipline.

3nergize is an app that enables you to calculate daily, weekly, and monthly expenses for the kWh consumed during a specific period.

It's not just an app that measures energy costs; it also provides information on how these costs are distributed, from energy generation to the applicable taxes.
